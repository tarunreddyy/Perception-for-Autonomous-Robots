# Perception-for-Autonomous-Robots

This repository contains code and projects developed as part of the course ENPM673 - Perception for Autonomous Robots at the University of Maryland. The course focuses on various computer vision techniques such as image processing, feature detection, object recognition, and localization.

## Projects
The following is a brief summary of the projects included in this repository:

- Ball_tracking: Implementing ball tracking using HSV masking and fitting parabolic curve to the data
- Plane_fitting: Implementing SLS, TLS and RANSAC fitting algorithms for point cloud data
- Camera_position_estimation: A computer vision program that detects an A4 piece of paper in a video feed and computes a homography matrix to determine the camera's position relative to the paper using world coordinates as a reference. The program's output is the camera's position, pitch, roll, and yaw.
- Image_stitching: Image stitching using feature detection, matching, RANSAC algorithm and Homography to obtain the final panorama image.

## Usage
Each project contains a separate folder with the necessary code, data, and instructions for running the project. In general, the code can be run using Python and the required libraries can be installed using pip.
